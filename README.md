## 🚀 Overview
EcoBin is an **end-to-end smart waste management system** developed as part of **Smart India Hackathon (SIH)**.  
It automates waste segregation and real-time bin monitoring using **IoT sensors, AI-based waste classification, and a cloud-connected dashboard**.

The system detects waste disposal events, tracks bin fill levels live, classifies waste into **Dry/Wet categories using AI**, and visualizes actionable insights for authorities. EcoBin is designed for **smart campuses and smart cities** with scalability in mind.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Traditional waste management suffers from:
- ❌ Manual segregation  
- ❌ Overflowing bins  
- ❌ Inefficient collection schedules  
- ❌ No real-time visibility  

EcoBin solves this by enabling **automated segregation, live monitoring, and data-driven waste collection**.
